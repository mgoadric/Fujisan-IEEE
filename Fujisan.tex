% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)



% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***

%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
    Challenges for physical solitaire puzzle games are typically designed in advance by humans and limited in number. Alternatively, some games incorporate rules for stochastic setup, where the human solver randomly sets up the game board before solving the challenge. \hl{These setup rules} greatly increase the number of possible challenges, but can often generate unsolvable or uninteresting challenges. To better understand \hl{the compromises involved in minimizing undesirable challenges, we examine three games where component design choices can influence the stochastic nature of the resulting challenge generation algorithms.} We evaluate the effect of these components and algorithms on challenge solvability, and challenge difficulty. \hl{We find that algorithms which control randomness through entangling components based on sub-elements of the puzzle mechanics can be simple for the solver to construct yet generate solvable and difficult challenges.}

\IEEEPARstart{P}{rocedural} content generation (PCG) algorithms are increasingly being used to derive new content for a wide variety of games\cite{PCGSURVEY}. Using the PCG taxonomy described by Togelius et al. \cite{SBPCG}, PCG can occur {\it offline} (beforehand) or {\it online} (dynamically during the game), the content can be {\it constructed}
by a system of rules, or use a {\it generate-and-test} process to winnow potential candidates for inclusion in the game, and the algorithm can be {\it deterministic} and fixed or {\it stochastic}, incorporating randomness. 

Following the puzzle terminology of Browne \cite{PUZZLENATURE}, such that there is a setter who creates challenges and a solver who solves them, \hl{we can apply the above PCG terminology to puzzle design.} Setters typically {\it construct} their challenges using creative yet {\it deterministic} means. 
Researchers have explored using PCG to replace the setter, employing metaheuristics to find interesting challenges for deductive logic puzzles, ranging from Sudoku \cite{SUDOKU} to Nonograms \cite{NONOGRAM}. These algorithms similarly construct their challenges offline, and guarantee they are solvable, but substitute {\it stochastic} algorithms for the creative human process. Khalifa and Fayek\cite{PUZZLELANG} investigated a combination of construction and generate-and-test PCG for \hl{Sokoban and related games} within a genetic algorithm framework, and this approach was extended to Monte Carlo Tree Search by Kartal et al. \cite{SOKOBAN}.

A less-explored variety of puzzle with relation to PCG 
are \hl{physical} solitaire games, for example
sliding block puzzles \cite{FIFTEEN} (including Rush Hour\footnote{https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/}), 
and Hi-Q (generalized peg solitaire) \cite{PEG}. In these games, solvers must manipulate physical pieces to solve a challenge. Since the initial setup for these games must be executed by the solver, providing the solver with predefined challenges \hl{created offline} and a solution book is common practice. PCG can also be applied to these games by, again, constructing challenges offline and guaranteeing they are solvable, as seen in recent work by Fogleman \cite{RUSHHOUR} and K{\"o}pp \cite{TANGRAM}. 

There are, however, alternative PCG approaches available for physical solitaire games, most popularly demonstrated by the card game Klondike Solitaire. In particular, this game uses an {\it online, stochastic, generate-and-test} PCG algorithm, which is as simple as shuffling the deck of cards at the start of the game. Also of note, the {\it test} portion of the generate-and-test algorithm is left to the solver as they play through the game. Wolter \cite{SOLITAIREVARIANTS} developed the Politaire system, and examines the effect of various shuffling algorithms across multiple solitaire card game variations. One variant called Thoughtful Solitaire, played such that all card locations are known to the solver at the beginning of the game, has been separately found to have setups between 82\% and 91.44\% solvable \cite{THOUGHTFUL}. 

When designing such a random setup process to assemble a challenge, two questions naturally arise: {\it Can all such challenges be solved? How difficult are the created challenges? } \hl{Since these puzzle challenges are created by the solver, they are restricted to using only the components included in the puzzle. However, as much of PCG research involves digital games and puzzles, where algorithms are only limited by computational time and space constraints, there is little research into the relationship between the structural design of physical puzzle components and PCG}. 

\hl{To understand this relationship, we examine three different styles of physical solitaire games with perfect information that incorporate} {\it online, stochastic, generate-and-test} \hl{PCG algorithms for challenge setup: BoxOff} \cite{BoxOffGAMES} \hl{, a token removal puzzle, Pretzel} \cite{de1981pretzel} \hl{, a card arrangement puzzle, and Fujisan\footnote{http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/Fuji-san}, a transportation puzzle. Each of these puzzles includes a basic algorithm where simple components (tokens or cards) are randomly shuffled to create a challenge. We define these components to become} {\it entangled} \hl{if their arrangement is no longer independent, either due to algorithmic constraints, or having been subsumed by new, larger components.}

We provide detailed descriptions of different \hl{game components and} challenge setup algorithms \hl{for each game}, then compare and contrast these multiple setup algorithms and constraints using computational simulations. Finally, we evaluate these algorithms with respect to solvability and difficulty. We find that \hl{entanglements which incorporate desirable constraints based on each puzzle's mechanics are more successful across both metrics}.

\section{BoxOff}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.8cm]{boxoff6x82.png}
\caption{A sample 6$\times$8 BoxOff challenge with three colors.}
\label{fig:boxoffbig}
\end{figure}

BoxOff is a 2D token removal puzzle designed by Stephen Myers  \cite{BoxOffGAMES}. Challenges for this puzzle consist of a 6$\times$8 grid of squares filled with exactly 16 each of three colors, an example of which is shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:boxoffbig}. The challenge is solved when every square in the grid has been eliminated.  The solver can eliminate two squares of the same color at a time if either of the following two rules apply.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The two squares are adjacent.
    \item All other squares inside the box that circumscribes the two squares have previously been eliminated.\footnote{Rule 1 is actually subsumed by this rule, however, we find it helpful to separate them into two cases to facilitate our component design discussions later.}
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:boxoffrules} shows an in-progress BoxOff challenge. The solver has a few options available, two of which are highlighted in dashed boxes. They could eliminate the two yellow squares in the upper-left quadrant using Rule 1, or eliminate the two blue squares in the middle using Rule 2. An invalid move is also shown in the upper right quadrant, where Rule 2 would not apply because of the blue square in the circumscribed box around the two red squares.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.8cm]{boxoffrules.png}
\caption{Application of Rules 1 and 2 to an in-progress BoxOff challenge, and an illustrative invalid move.}
\label{fig:boxoffrules}
\end{figure}


Browne and Maire previously investigated altering the game design parameters for BoxOff using Monte Carlo simulation \cite{MCPUZZLE}. They explored multiple grid sizes and numbers of colors, ultimately finding that challenges generated for the original 6$\times$8 puzzle configuration described by Myers were highly solvable and robust against random solvers. Other configurations, either of smaller board sizes, or more colors, exhibited poor solvability. In particular, we will examine the 4$\times$6 board with four colors, where challenge solvability was approximately 25\%, and the 6$\times$6 board with six colors, where challenge solvability was less than 5\%.

%\begin{figure}[t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{boxoff4x6.png}
%\caption{4$\times$6 BoxOff challenge with four colors, %generated with a simple shuffle of the 24 color tokens. }
%\label{fig:boxoffbasic}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Components and Algorithms}
Here we explore two different sets of physical components and their resulting algorithms that can be used for challenge setup for Boxoff. 

The components of a physical BoxOff puzzle consist of circular tokens equal to the number of grid squares. These tokens are equally distributed among the number of colors. 
With these components, the solver can employ a simple shuffling algorithm to create a challenge.
\begin{quote}
    {\it \bf Shuffled:} Shuffle the color tokens randomly, and arrange them into a grid.
\end{quote}

THIS NEEDS WORK FOR BOTH 4x6 and 6x6
We can use the multinomial theorem to determine that this method can create
$\frac{24!}{4!^{6}??} \approx 10^{???}$ possible challenges.  We divide by ?????? here and in subsequent calculations to account for BoxOff challenges displaying rotational, horizontal, and vertical symmetry, however, this slightly underestimates due to some challenges displaying more than one symmetry.

This shuffling works well on moderate sized boards with few colors, but as demonstrated by Browne and Maire, it suffers when applied to more colors, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:boxoff666}. The uniform nature of the shuffling appears to prevent a critical mass of adjacent tokens of the same color. Such adjacent tokens are the only way Rule 1 above can be fulfilled so that other more distant tokens can be eliminated.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.6cm]{boxoff666basic.png}
\caption{A Sample 6$\times$6 BoxOff challenge with six colors, generated with a simple shuffle of the 36 color tokens. }
\label{fig:boxoff666}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.6cm]{boxoffltiles.png}
\caption{Sample L-tiles for BoxOff challenge creation. Tiles can be rotated 180 degrees, and the dashed line shows how they can be flipped. }
\label{fig:ltiles}
\end{figure}

%CAN I CONFIRM THIS WITH GRAPHS, LIKE CONNECTEDNESS BELOW????

To address this issue, we introduce an {\it entangled} abstraction for creating the challenge using L-shaped tiles, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ltiles}. These tiles allow us to entangle the colors on the tiles to create particular local color distributions.
Our goal in creating these tiles is to encourage more adjacent tokens of the same color. However, we also must avoid creating situations where all tiles are adjacent to tokens of the same color, else the puzzle becomes too easy to solve. 

For both the 4$\times$6 and 6$\times$6 grids, each tile is composed of exactly two squares of the same color, which we label $S$, and one square of a different color, labeled $D$. Each color is chosen as $S$ twice to ensure an equal distribution of the adjacent squares. We then distribute the third square colors using a cyclic arrangement of the colors, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:boxoffcycle}, where arrows are drawn from $S$ to $D$ for each tile in the set.  To increase the number of possible challenges, these tiles can be flipped to a mirror image along the center square of the L.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{boxoffcycle.png}
\caption{Cycle of color connections used to construct L-shaped tiles for BoxOff challenges, 4$\times$6 with four colors on the left, and 6$\times$6 BoxOff challenges with six colors on the right.}
\label{fig:boxoffcycle}
\end{figure}

HOW MANY CHALLENGES WORK ON THESE NUMBERS???
Each of these tiles has two possible orientations, for a total of $\frac{2^{12}12!}{4} \approx 10^{14}$ possible challenges. 
The algorithm to create a challenge then is as follows:

\begin{quote}
    {\it \bf L-Tiles:} Shuffle and flip the tiles randomly, then arrange into a grid of connected 2$\times$3 subgrids. 
\end{quote}

Figure \ref{fig:boxofftiles} shows a 4$\times$6 grid created with L-tiles. To physically play BoxOff with this tile setup, the solver will need to place neutral tokens on each square as they are eliminated, continuing until the board is full of tokens. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.6cm]{boxoff46tiles.png}
\caption{A sample 4$\times$6 BoxOff challenge with four colors, generated using L-shaped tiles. }
\label{fig:boxofftiles}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluation}

We encoded a Monte Carlo BoxOff challenge generator using C\#, and implemented a breadth-first solver for BoxOff challenges. For each PCG algorithm, we generated 1000 random challenges. For each generated challenge in our trials, we recorded if the challenge was solvable. The code used for our simulations is available on Github \footnote{http://github.com/mgoadric/fujisan}. 
To enable testing for statistical significance on solvability between these algorithms, we divided our pool of generated challenges into 10 trials of 100 challenges. We repeated this for both the 4$\times$6 with four colors puzzle and the 6$\times$6 with six colors puzzle.
 
We will use the two criteria of solvability and difficulty to quantify each of the above \hl{components and algorithms. }
First, we judge a PCG algorithm to be working well when a high percentage of generated challenges are solvable by our solver. Beyond solvability, we also wish for PCG algorithms to have a strong inclination to generate interesting and difficult challenges for the solver. 

\subsubsection{Solvability}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{boxonsolve.png}
\caption{Effect of challenge generation algorithms on solvability for BoxOff 4$\times$6 with four colors. $P(S_p)$ denoted in red, and $P(S_r)$ shown in blue.}
\label{fig:boxoffsolvediff}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{6x6solvediff.png}
\caption{Effect of challenge generation algorithms on solvability for BoxOff 6$\times$6 with six colors. $P(S_p)$ denoted in red, and $P(S_r)$ shown in blue.}
\label{fig:boxoff666solvediff}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:boxoffsolvediff} shows the challenge solvability in red for the 4$\times$6 with four color BoxOff. This plot displays the distribution of the two PCG algorithms across the 10 trials in a box-and-whisker plot. The mean for each method is marked with a green triangle. 

We find the {\bf L-Tiles} setup method produces solvable challenges at a probability of 0.88, a marked increase over the {\bf Shuffled} probability of 0.27, with this difference being statistically significant.
Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:boxoff666solvediff} shows the solvability distributions in red for the 6$\times$6 with six color puzzle. We again see a drastic increase in solvability, moving from 0.03 for {\bf Shuffled} up to 0.57 for {\bf L-Tiles}. 

\subsubsection{Difficulty}

Following Browne and Maire \cite{MCPUZZLE}, if a challenge is solvable by the solver choosing random moves each time, then the challenge lacks difficulty and interest. Denoting the probability of solvability using the breadth-first search solver as $P(S_p)$ and the probability of the random solver as $P(S_r)$, we can calculate $P(S_p) - P(S_r)$, the difference between the intelligent and random solvability. Figures \ref{fig:boxoffsolvediff} and \ref{fig:boxoff666solvediff} also show in blue the solvability rate for these algorithm when using a random solver. 

We see in both cases for {\bf L-Tiles}, there is an increase in the random solver performance over {\bf Shuffled}. However, there remains a significant gap between the general and random solvability in both puzzles. For the 4$\times$6 with four colors, this difference is 0.62, and for 6$\times$6 with six colors, this difference is 0.495. We can conclude that while more easy challenges generated from {\bf L-Tiles}, the large majority of generated solvable challenges involve difficult solutions.

\section{Pretzel}
The Montana family of patience card games has many variations known by many names, including Gaps, Spaces, Vacancies, Clown, Paganini, Red Moon, and Blue Moon. One variant, which allows no re-shuffles or re-deals, is a puzzle described and named by de Bruijn \cite{helmstetter2004searching}, called Pretzel solitaire.

Shuffle a deck of $S$ suits, each with $V$ values. Deal the shuffled cards face-up into a grid with $S$ rows, each with $V$ columns. Remove the lowest valued card of each suit (traditionally aces) and place them in a new column to the left of the existing grid in a prescribed order (traditionally, from top to bottom: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs). Doing so vacates $S$ cells in the grid, thereafter called holes. A sample Pretzel setup with $S=4$ and $V=4$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pretzelbasic}.

The solver's goal is to arrange all cards into ascending sorted order, one suit per row, following a single rule:

1) A card may be moved from any location in the grid into any hole only if the card being moved is of the same suit and exactly one rank higher in value than the card immediately to the hole's left.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.8cm]{pretzelbasic.png}
\caption{Pretzel solitaire challenge with four suits and four ranks, generated with a random shuffle.}
\label{fig:pretzelbasic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Components and Algorithms}
Here we explore three different algorithms that can be used for challenge setup for Pretzel. Each algorithm uses the features of the existing components, in this case a standard French deck of cards, in different ways. For two setup algorithms (Random Suits and Sequential Suits) we introduce entanglement by first dividing the deck into smaller decks according to suit. Although this entanglement is not preserved during play, the lasting effects of such deck substitution during setup are nonetheless observable by measures similar to other games explored.

In all setup algorithms described below, ``deal out" denotes placing cards face-up into the play grid starting in the upper-left corner, proceeding to the right within the same row, and beginning a new row each time $V$ columns are filled.

\begin{quote}
    {\bf Shuffled:} Shuffle the entire deck and deal out all cards.
\end{quote}

The number of possible challenges that result from the standard shuffle is the total number of permutations of cards in the deck, namely ($S$$V$)!.

\begin{quote}
    {\bf Random Suits:} Divide the deck into $S$ smaller decks, each comprising all cards of a single suit. Shuffle each small deck separately. Next, take the top card of each small deck, shuffle these $S$ cards together, and deal them out. Again, take the top card of each small deck, shuffle these cards together, and continue dealing out. Proceed in like fashion until all cards have been dealt.
\end{quote}

HOW TO CALCULATE NUMBER OF CHALLENGES?

\begin{quote}
    {\bf Sequential Suits:} Divide the deck into $S$ smaller decks, each comprising all cards of a single suit. Shuffle each small deck separately. Next, deal the top card from the first small deck, then the top card of the second small deck, and so on.  When the top card of each small deck has been dealt, return to the first small deck and deal the top card, then the top card of the second small deck, etc. Proceed in like fashion until all cards have been dealt.
\end{quote}

\label{fig:pretzelsequential}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Evaluation}

As with BoxOff we encoded a Monte Carlo Pretzel challenge generator using C\#, and a breadth-first solver for Pretzel challenges. For each PCG algorithm, we generated 1000 random challenges. For each generated challenge in our trials, we recorded whether the challenge was solvable, and if so, we also recorded the minimum solution length found with our solver. The code used for our simulations is available on Github \footnote{http://github.com/jdroscha/pretzel-solitaire-solver}. To enable testing for statistical significance on solvability between these algorithms, we divided our pool of generated challenges into 10 trials of 100 challenges. 

Figure \ref{fig:pretzel44solved} shows the distribution of solvability for the three PCG algorithms across the 10 trials in a box-and-whisker plot. The mean for each method is marked with a green triangle.

\section{Fujisan}

In Fujisan, a solver must find a way to cooperatively move four Shinto Priests to the top of Mt. Fuji through incremental steps up the mountainside. Functionally, the area of play consists of a grid of spaces arranged into two rows by twelve columns. Each space contains a single value in the range of 0 to 5, inclusive. The two middle columns together comprise the mountain {\it summit}, while each other column forms a {\it step} of the mountain. Four pawns, representing the Priests, start off the mountain, just outside the two columns furthest from the summit.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{priestrulesfixed.png}
\caption{The start of a solution demonstrating the rules of Priest movement, with move notation followed by the matching rule. }
\label{fig:priestrules}
\end{figure}

The goal of the solver is to move Priests one at a time until all four are at the summit. A Priest can be moved according to the following rules:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item No more than one Priest may occupy a space at any given time.

\item A Priest may move onto a space if that space's value matches the number of unoccupied spaces the Priest must move in a straight line, left or right, to get there (including the destination space itself, but not including the Priest's starting space). %For example, a Priest may move onto a space containing a 4 if there are three unoccupied spaces between it and the Priest.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Occupied spaces (containing intervening Priests) are not counted when determining the distance from a Priest to a given space. %For example, a Priest may move onto a space containing a 2 if there are three occupied spaces and one unoccupied space between it and the Priest.
\end{enumerate}
\item A Priest may move freely up and down between the two spaces of any given step of the mountain. %This is the only manner in which a Priest may move onto a space containing a 0.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A Priest's first move from the starting position must land on the mountain; that is, the Priest cannot move up or down while on the ground.
\end{enumerate}

\item A Priest that lands on the mountain's summit can no longer move left or right, but may still move freely up or down within the column.\footnote{The original rules released for the piecepack version of Fujisan also allowed a Priest on the summit to freely move left and right, provided the Priest remained at the summit. The summit rule as written here was a change made for the Engraved Tiles version, and retained for the Dominoes version, both described in Section \ref{section:pcgalgs}. For purposes of statistical comparison, we have chosen to use this formulation of the rule for the computational simulations of all versions discussed.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A Priest may pass over the summit as part of a move.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:priestrules} shows a visual example of how these rules can be used to begin solving a sample challenge. We denote each move using a notation established by \hl{Don} Kirkby\footnote{http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/Fuji\_2dsan\_2fSolutionOne} \hl{in which} the Priest moving (A, C, M, or S) is followed by either U, D, L, or R, for Up, Down, Left, Right, respectively. On L and R moves, we include the unoccupied spaces traveled, with occupied spaces skipped shown in parentheses. The goal summit spaces are denoted in gray. 

%====================================================================================
%\subsection{Piecepack Components}

%Fujisan was created specifically for the piecepack game system\footnote{http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/SolitaryConfinement}. The piecepack is a set of board game parts that can be used to design and play a wide variety of games. The piecepack was designed and placed into the public domain in 2000. Figure \ref{fig:piecepackinfinite} shows one published version of the piecepack, including a rulebook of over 50 games that can be played with a piecepack.

%Although several variations and ``expansions'' exist, a standard piecepack consists of the following components:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 24 square tiles, indexed on the obverse in four suits (suns, moons, crowns, and arms) of six values each (null, ace, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and divided on the reverse into a 2$\times$2 space grid.
%\item 24 round coins, each sized to fit comfortably into one space of a tile, marked on the obverse with one of the six values and on the reverse with one of the four suits.
%\item 4 cubic dice, one per suit, each side marked with one of the six values.
%\item 4 pawns, one per suit, each sized to fit comfortably into one space of a tile.
%\end{itemize}

%Fujisan uses the reverse side of 21 of the 24 tiles to form the mountain, the obverse of all 24 coins to assign values to spaces, and the four pawns to represent the Priests. Ace coins are assigned a value of 1, while null coins are assigned a value of 0. The dice are not used.

%====================================================================================

\subsection{Components and Algorithms}
\label{section:pcgalgs}
\noindent
Here we explore \hl{three different sets of physical components and their resulting} algorithms that can be used for challenge setup for Fujisan. 

Fujisan was created specifically for the piecepack game system \cite{GAMESYSTEM}. The piecepack is a set of board game parts that can be used to design and play a wide variety of games. \hl{The mountain in Fujisan was constructed with game tiles representing a 2$\times$2 grid. The values were added using 24 round coins, which represented the cross product of two sets: suits (sun, moon, crown, arms) and values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Values are indicated on the front of the coin, while suits are found on the back.}

We examine first a simple algorithms that can make use of the piecepack coin components to generate randomness. 

\begin{quote}
    
  {\it \bf Shuffled:} Shuffle the 24 coins face-down. For each space on the board, randomly select one coin and place it face-up on this space.
  
\end{quote}

We can use the multinomial theorem to determine that this method can create
$\frac{24!}{4!^{6}4} \approx 10^{14}$ possible challenges.  We divide by 4 here and in subsequent calculations to account for Fujisan challenges displaying rotational, horizontal, and vertical symmetry, however, this slightly underestimates due to some challenges displaying more than one symmetry.

However, if two 0 coins end up placed in same row, then it becomes impossible to move a Priest onto that row. This creates holes in our challenges and reduces the number of solvable setups. 
More importantly, when both spaces of either of the summit columns contain 0s, the challenge becomes impossible to solve.

The original published Fujisan ruleset was devised to address the issue of double 0 steps, adding the constraint that each step must have two different values. This was achieved by using the suit information on the backs of the coins to {\hl entangle} the coins as they are placed, \hl{similar to the Sequential Suits method for Pretzel}.

\begin{quote}
    
  {\it \bf piecepack:} Shuffle the 24 coins face-down, and separate into four groups based on their suit. Then repeatedly place two coins on the two right-most available spaces, choosing from each of the suits in turn (sun, moon, crown, arms).
\end{quote}

With each space limited to choosing from a particular suit, the piecepack algorithm will generate $\frac{6!^4}{4} \approx 10^{10}$ possible challenges. 
This algorithm will guarantee there are no double numbers on a step, thus eliminating the double 0 issue noted above. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{engravedsample.png}

\begin{figure}[b]
\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{fujisan-engraved.png}
\caption{A sample Fujisan challenge from the Engraved Tiles algorithm.}
\label{fig:tileexample}
\end{figure}



Another way to \hl{entangle the components in Fujisan} is to combine the values with the 2$\times$2 tiles, engraving numerals onto the spaces. Here, we explore creating tiles with every possible pairing of values 0 through 5, including pairing a value with itself, and repeating these values diagonally on the tiles. Example tiles of this style are shown in Figure \ref{fig:engravedsample}. We remove the 0:0 pairing, since it can create unsolvable challenges, leaving 20 tiles.

\begin{quote}
    
  {\it \bf Engraved Tiles:} Shuffle the tiles face-down. Then, assemble the mountain by turning tiles face-up, using six for the bottom layer, five for the next layer, then four, then three, and finally two. The summit will be the center four spaces.
\end{quote}

This further constrains each pair of numbers to appear no more than once in the puzzle, except for the top two tiles. There are 20 possible tiles, and only 10 of them can be seen once the puzzle is constructed, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tileexample}. 15 of these tiles have two possible orientations, for a total of $\sum_{i = 5}^{10}\frac{{15 \choose i}\binom{5}{10 - i}2^{i}10!}{4} \approx 10^{13}
$ possible challenges.

Furthermore, a standard double-six domino set, which includes 28 dominoes, 
can be used \hl{as entangled components}. If we eliminate those dominoes that include a 6, along with all doubles, we are left with 15 dominoes. 

\begin{quote}
    
  {\it \bf Dominoes:} Shuffle the dominoes face-down. Place 12 of these dominoes face-up in a row to create the mountain. Place a face-down domino on each side of the mountain to denote the starting locations for the Priests. Place the remaining face-down domino horizontally in the middle to raise up the two central dominoes, denoting the summit.
\end{quote}

This constraint is similar to the Engraved Tiles algorithm, but with a subset of the value pairs, thus a different probability on their selection.  Additionally, unlike the Engraved Tiles algorithm, the summit values are distinct from the two steps closest the summit.
With 15 possible dominoes, only 12 of them are used in the challenge, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dominoexample}. Each of these dominoes has two possible orientations, for a total of $\frac{{15 \choose 12}2^{12}12!}{4} \approx 10^{14}$ possible challenges.

\subsection{Evaluation}

 \noindent
%First, our stochastic generation algorithm must be easy for the solver to execute without complicated lookup tables or large numbers of components. 


\subsubsection{Solvability}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{standalonesolve2.png}
\caption{Effect of challenge generation algorithms on solvability.}
\label{fig:strategycomp}
\end{figure}

We encoded a Monte Carlo Fujisan challenge generator using C\#, along with an A* solver for Fujisan challenges. Our admissible heuristic for A* is the number of empty spaces on the summit. For each PCG algorithm, we generated 1000 random challenges.
For each generated challenge in our trials, we recorded if the challenge was solvable, and if so, we also recorded the minimum solution length found with our A* solver. The code used for our simulations is available on Github \footnote{http://github.com/mgoadric/fujisan}. 
\hl{To enable testing for statistical significance on solvability between these algorithms, we divided our pool of generated challenges into 10 trials of 100 challenges. }
 
Figure \ref{fig:strategycomp} shows the distribution of solvability for the four PCG algorithms across the 10 trials in a box-and-whisker plot. The mean for each method is marked with a green triangle. Each method produces a healthy \hl{probability} of solvable challenges; every trial was above 75\% solvable. {\bf Shuffled} \hl{has} the lowest mean value for solvability and \hl{this} result is significantly lower than the other three algorithms, which is confirmed by t-tests using a p-value of 0.05. Within the top three algorithms, only {\bf Dominoes} is statistically higher than {\bf piecepack}. 

SAY MORE HERE NOW THAT CONNECTEDNESS IS IN GENERAL DISCUSSION BELOW
\subsubsection{Difficulty}

Unfortunately, the difficulty metric of Browne and Maire \cite{MCPUZZLE} is unsuitable for Fujisan. Across all of our PCG algorithms, we found that $P(S_r)$, the probability that a random solver would win, was less than 0.003, making their $P(S_p) - P(S_r)$ metric equivalent to solvability. 

Instead, we define challenge difficulty here to be the minimum number of moves required to solve the challenge, and are interested in the distribution of challenge difficulties generated by each algorithm. We compare here the median level of challenge difficulty generated by each algorithm. The shortest possible solution to a Fujisan challenge involves eight moves, while 
the longest-known constructed challenge requires 62 moves\footnote{http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/Fuji-san\#Heading9}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{standalonediff2.png}
\caption{Histograms showing the effect of challenge generation algorithms on difficulty.}
\label{fig:difficultycomp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:difficultycomp} shows histograms of the minimum solution length for solvable challenges, pooled across all trials for each algorithm. The median is denoted with a dotted line. Our algorithms appear to follow a Poisson distribution rather than a normal distribution, since the smallest possible solution length for any challenge is 8, and the maximum solution length is currently unbounded. We employ a Kruskal-Wallis H-test \cite{KRUSKAL} to determine if the median difficulty of our four algorithms is statistically the same, and we reject this null hypothesis very strongly, with a p-value of $6.4 \times 10^{-9}$.

The algorithm responsible for this result is {\bf Engraved Tiles}. We can see a strong tendency to have shorter solution lengths, with almost 10\% of challenges having a solution length of eight or nine, whereas for {\bf Dominoes}, this is true for only 3\% of challenges. In {\bf Engraved Tiles}, there are five tiles that contain a 0 value; since there will be ten total tiles hidden, on average a challenge will contain 2.5 zeros values. It appears that 0 values are one part of what makes Fujisan challenges interesting, since having fewer 0 values decreases the challenge difficulty.

\section{Entangled Components}

Coarse versus fine abstraction of components. 

background vs foreground (doesn't work for Pretzel)

Fujisand and Boxoff can be reworked, with L-Tiles, but not with Pretzel or token Boxoff.

Individual, connected through algorithm via component attribute (suit), embedded into tiles at a higher level.

Good algorithms make use of the embedded elements



Boxoff, we can use tiles to connect the pieces and clump the colors to enable starting points for the puzzles. Maintained the global uniform distribution, but altered the local connections.

Pretzel, we create stripes based on the suits.  But cards are both background and foreground components.

Fujisan, we can use tiles with two mechanics, one within the tile, one between the tiles.

Important statistics about each algorithm are summarized in Table \ref{table_stats}, namely the number of possible challenges, the number of times a value may be repeated in a challenge, if the same value can occur in two spaces on the same step, and if the value pair present on a step can be repeated elsewhere in the challenge.

Table \ref{table_example} summarizes our results on the three evaluation metrics. We can see computational evidence that the original {\bf piecepack} ruleset is an improvement over both the {\bf Pure Random} and {\bf Shuffled} setup algorithm as hoped by the designer. While {\bf Engraved Tiles} simplifies the ease of physical setup over the {\bf piecepack} version, it is at the cost of challenge difficulty. The {\bf Dominoes} algorithm maintains this easy setup and returns the challenge generation to a reasonable difficulty distribution.


Why does entanglement work for BoxOff?

in the 4x6 board, there are 38 unique neighbors. with 4 colors, randomly distributed, we find that on average ???

If we constrain at least 8 of them to be the same color, with our L-Tiles, then we are more likely to be in the solvable range.

\caption{Average neighbor similarity for 4$\times$6 with four color BoxOff challenges across each setup algorithm. }
\label{fig:connected}
\end{figure}

Why does entanglement work for Pretzel?


Why does entanglement work for Fujisan?


To understand these results, we first explore the connections between steps in a challenge. We say step $A$ is connected to step $B$ in Fujisan if there is a move available according to rule 2 from $B$ to $A$. While critical to solving most challenges, we simplify our connectedness calculation by ignoring the impact of intermediate Priests between $B$ and $A$. 

Figure \ref{fig:connected} shows the average step connectedness within a challenge for each setup algorithm, differentiating solvable challenges in black from unsolvable challenges in white. We can see a large divide between solvable and unsolvable challenges on this metric for each algorithm, with higher connectivity always related to higher solvability. Also, as shown in Table \ref{table_stats}, both {\bf piecepack} and {\bf Dominoes} require that each step has two unique values. In these two algorithms, this uniqueness constraint strongly increases the connectedness of both solvable and unsolvable challenges, but the divide remains intact.

Second, for {\bf Engraved Tiles} and {\bf Dominoes}, repetition of pairs of values on a step are either restricted to the summit or not allowed elsewhere in the challenge. This causes the connections between steps to be more distributed and bind the puzzle together as a whole, instead of breaking apart into disjoint pieces. {\bf Dominoes} combines two constraints to create well-connected and well-distributed challenges.

\section{Conclusion}   \label{sec:Conclusion}

\noindent
Our work helps frame puzzle generation, \hl{particularly for physical} solitaire puzzle games, within the taxonomy of procedural content generation (PCG). By examining variants for challenge creation, we can see that subtle changes in the \hl{game components and the subsequent} random distribution used in an algorithm can have large-scale changes on the generated content.

There are many open questions related to physical games and PCG. First, we believe there is work to be done in formalizing an ease of physical setup metric. A simple approximation would be the time complexity of the algorithm, however, certain operations that are straightforward to a computer can be difficult for humans to track, and vice versa. With a formal metric, game and puzzle designers could be inclined to include more intricate PCG algorithms in their designs when provided guarantees these algorithms can reasonably be executed by a human player.

%\subsubsection{Ease of Physical Setup}

%{\bf Shuffled} is \hl{a straightforward algorithm}, since the coins can be shuffled on the table quickly, then added one by one to the board spaces. The {\bf piecepack} constraint, while equivalent in the number of actual coin placements, is a little more difficult to setup by the solver. Tracking the ordering of suits and following the pattern can slow down a solver setup, but this ordering can be quickly memorized on repeated play.

%{\bf Engraved Tiles} shows a marked improvement in physical setup ease. The numbers are already on the tiles, so the challenge is created in the process of building the mountain; no additional algorithm is needed. Likewise with {\bf Dominoes}, the challenge is again encoded in the board setup, and with fewer tiles, this setup is even more elegant.

A further point to clarify is the exact relationship between the minimum solution length and challenge difficulty. We believe this metric can be expanded to include the branching factor along the solution path. Also, we have ignored a difference in move clarity for Fujisan. Up and down moves are always available for Priests on the mountain, but left and right moves must be visually identified and recalculated as spaces become occupied. It is unclear, therefore, whether both types of movement contribute equally to the level of challenge experienced by the solver. A more sophisticated difficulty metric could take these into account and further differentiate the above setup algorithms.

Finally, are there general methods that allow solvers to {\it construct} challenges online to guarantee solvability, as opposed to the {\it generate-and-test} algorithms discussed here? While this may be possible in certain situations, as employed in another piecepack solitaire game Cell Management \footnote{http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/CellManagement}, care must be taken that the construction process does not give away the solution to the challenge.
